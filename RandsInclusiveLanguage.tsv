When someone says	Slackbot responds
"you guys, these guys, my guys, those guys, hey guys, hi guys, the guys, these guys, thanks guys, guys?"	"Instead of *guys*, perhaps you mean *pals*?... *[Please consider editing your message so it's more inclusive]*"
"guyz, guyss"	"Instead of some variant of *guys*, would you consider editing your message so it doesn't exclude people who aren't guys?"
CHWD?	"Cisgender Hetero White Dude. But please consider using the full term ""cisgender, heterosexual white man‚Äù or similar. That would both make it more approachable for those unfamiliar with this obscure initialism, and prevent reducing people down to initialisms."
"URP?, URPs?"	"Underrepresented person(s). But please consider using the full term ""members of traditionally underrepresented groups"" or similar; people don't like to be made into acronyms, _especially_ when they are already marginalized. See: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underrepresented_group"
"URM?, URMs?"	"Underrepresented minorit(y|ies). But please consider using the full term ""members of traditionally underrepresented groups"" or similar; people don't like to be made into acronyms, _especially_ when they are already marginalized. See: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underrepresented_group"
"URG?, URGs?"	"Underrepresented group(s). But please consider using the full term ""members of traditionally underrepresented groups"" or similar; people don't like to be made into acronyms, _especially_ when they are already marginalized. See: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underrepresented_group"
crazy	"Using the word *crazy* is considered by some to be insensitive to sufferers of mental illness, maybe you mean *outrageous*?..."
midget	"Please edit your message. I think you meant ""little person""  or ""dwarf""  www.lpaonline.org/the-m-word"
pimp	"Unless you're talking about ""a man who controls sex workers and arranges clients for them, taking part of their earnings in return,"" we'd appreciate it if you find another word instead of *pimp*.  *Edit your message* and use that new word. Promote? Promoter? Evangelist? Evangelize?"
"got balls,has balls,takes balls"	"Instead of *balls*, please consider using a less sexist term such as ""courage"" or ""grit""."
off the reservation	"~off the reservation~ next time, perhaps ""outside of norms""?"
ghetto	"Start a better habit now.  Edit your message and replace ~ghetto~... perhaps ""improvised"" or ""jury-rigged"" instead?"

sack up	"Instead of *sack up*, would you be willing to consider a less-gendered phrase like ""toughen up""?"
insane	The word *insane* is considered by some to be insensitive to sufferers of mental illness. Perhaps you mean *irrational*?
"open the kimono,opening the kimono"	"Please consider using a different expression--in Western use, it is associated with Geisha (who are considered prostitutes in the simplistic Western view) getting naked for businessmen. Beyond that, it is cultural appropriation because Kimono wearing and the contexts for it are not understood in Western culture."
"goddamnit,goddammit,goddamn,goddam,oh my God"	"It's hard for me as a bot to know whether you're respectfully referring to the deity or simply invoking its name for effect, but if the latter, please consider editing your message and avoiding future uses of that name for effect -- some people here are uncomfortable with that."
sexy	"Did you mean ""zesty""?"
slave	"If you are referring to a data replication strategy, please consider a term such as ""follower"" or ""replica""."
